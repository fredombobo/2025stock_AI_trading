# Development Plan

This document outlines the planned milestones for the A-share quant trading system.

## Phase 1: Data Layer
- [ ] Implement data ingestion clients for market and fundamental data.
- [ ] Build a unified data repository (SQL + Parquet) with schema management.
- [ ] Provide utilities for on-demand backfilling and scheduled updates.

## Phase 2: Factor and Feature Engineering
- [ ] Implement technical indicators (momentum, moving averages, turnover).
- [ ] Add fundamental factor calculations such as PE, ROE, and growth metrics.
- [ ] Cache computed factors to speed up backtests.

## Phase 3: Strategy Engine
- [ ] Implement base strategy class with signal generation helpers.
- [ ] Add sample strategies (e.g., moving-average crossover, sector rotation).
- [ ] Support parameter tuning and walk-forward validation.

## Phase 4: Portfolio and Risk Management
- [ ] Position sizing and capital allocation algorithms.
- [ ] Risk controls including stop loss, drawdown guard, and leverage limits.
- [ ] Portfolio rebalancing policies and transaction cost models.

## Phase 5: Execution and Monitoring
- [ ] Order management with broker adapters.
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export and alert notifications.
- [ ] Deployment scripts for Docker-based production environments.

These milestones provide a high-level roadmap. Each phase can be tackled independently and iteratively refined.
